                           PAROLI LAUNCHER

The launcher is a script that will load tichy and all the servcies and
plugins, then start a dbus client that allow clients to start
applications by name.


                         RUN IT ON THE PHONE

For the DBus connection to succedd, we need to make sure than the
proper dbus configurations file are installed in the filesystem. That
is the file ./data/dbus/org.tichy.launcher.service should go into
/usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/ and the file ./data/dbus/tichy.conf
should go in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/

To start a application send a dbus call to org.tichy.launcher, object
/Launcher method org.tichy.Launcher.Launch(s). The parameter being the
name of the application we want to start.

You can use dbus-send to make the call :

  dbus-send --system --dest='org.tichy.launcher' /Launcher \
  --print-reply org.tichy.Launcher.Launch string:Paroli-Contacts

or you can use paroli-launcher --launch :

  paroli-launcher --launch Paroli-Contacts


                        RUN IT ON THE DESKTOP

It is basically the same, except that we can use the session bus
instead of the system bus. Then we don't need to have the dbus conf
file installed.

To use the session bus, use the --session argument :

  paroli-launcher --session

then to start an application (for example Paroli-Dialer) :

  paroli-launcher --session --launch Paroli-Dialer
