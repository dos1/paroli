                            PAROLI SCRIPTS

* paroli

  The 'paroli' script can be used to run paroli direclty, without
  starting a d-bus server. It can be run on the phone or the desktop
  (assuming that all the required modules are installed)

  to get the list of possible options run it with the --help command
  line argument.

* paroli-launcher

  The launcher is a script that will load tichy and all the servcies
  and plugins, then start a dbus client that allow clients to start
  applications by name.

  * Run it on the phone

    For the DBus connection to succedd, we need to make sure than the
    proper dbus configurations file are installed in the
    filesystem. That is the file
    ./data/dbus/org.tichy.launcher.service should go into
    /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/ and the file
    ./data/dbus/tichy.conf should go in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/

    To start a application send a dbus call to org.tichy.launcher,
    object /Launcher method org.tichy.Launcher.Launch(s). The
    parameter being the name of the application we want to start.

    You can use dbus-send to make the call :

    dbus-send --system --dest='org.tichy.launcher' /Launcher \
    --print-reply org.tichy.Launcher.Launch string:Paroli-Contacts

    or you can use paroli-launcher --launch :

    paroli-launcher --launch Paroli-Contacts


  * Run it on the desktop

    It is basically the same, except that we can use the session bus
    instead of the system bus. Then we don't need to have the dbus
    conf file installed.

    To use the session bus, use the --session argument :

    paroli-launcher --session

    then to start an application (for example Paroli-Dialer) :

    paroli-launcher --session --launch Paroli-Dialer
